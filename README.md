## Explicit bounds on Siegel-zeros and its applications
This repository contains the SageMath notebooks used in the thesis entitled "Explicit bounds on Siegel zeros and its applications" written by F. Brice Razakarinoro.

In the thesis, the author provided explicit upper bounds on Siegel zeros of quadratic number fields. That is, the case of imaginary and real quadratic number fields are treated. The method used in this manuscript is mainly based on the paper of Goldfeld and Schinzel entitled "On Siegel zeros" published in 1975. All the computations in the thesis are included here, mostly the detailed numerical computations in the first two chapters. 

The notebooks in the current repository can be accessed via any standard software such as Jupiter Notebooks using the SageMath kernel.
