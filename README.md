## Explicit bounds on Siegel-zeros and its applications
This repository contains the SageMath notebooks used in the thesis entitled "Explicit bounds on Siegel zeros and its applications" written by F.B. Razakarinoro.

In the thesis, we provided explicit upper bounds on Siegel zeros of quadratic number fields. That is, the case of imaginary and real quadratic number fields are treated. The method used in this manuscript is mainly based on the paper of Goldfeld and Schinzel entitled "$\textit{On Siegel's zero}$" published in 1975. All the computations in the thesis are included here, mostly the detailed numerical computations in the first two chapters. 

The notebooks in the current repository can be accessed via any standard software such as Jupiter Notebooks using the SageMath kernel. In our case, we used the version 9.3 of SageMath. Note also that all the computations are done by using complex ball fields $\texttt{CBF}$, that is the numerical values appear as a midpoint-radius representation.

### Chapter 1: An improved explicit upper bound of Siegel zeros for imaginary quadratic fields
The notebook used in this chapter is called $\texttt{Negative case - numerical computations}$.

### Chapter 2: An explicit upper bound of Siegel zeros for real quadratic fields
In the second chapter, we wrote two notebooks according to the case that is treated:

  $\bullet\quad\texttt{Positive case - numerical computations}$ for the case of real quadratic fields,
  $\bullet\quad\texttt{Positive case - fund.units of small size}$ for the case of real quadratic fields with small fundamental units.
